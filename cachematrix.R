## Caching the Inverse of a Matrix
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be 
## some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than 
## to compute it repeatedly. 
## This assignment is to write a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.
## 1. makeCacheMatrix
## 2. cacheSolve

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        minverse <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                minverse <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setinverse <- function(inverse) minverse <<- inverse
        getinverse <- function() minverse
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setinverse = setinverse,
             getinverse = getinverse)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated 
## (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve function 
## should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        minverse <- x$getinverse()
        if(!is.null(minverse)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(minverse)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        minverse <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setinverse(minverse)
        minverse
}
